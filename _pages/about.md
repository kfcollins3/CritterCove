title: "About Coming Up Critters"

Hi! My name is Anna and I am a kidpreneur. My goal is to get kids excited about taking care of the planet in a fun and creative way. When you build a Critter Cove, you're not just making a bug home—you're making a difference!

I created Critter Coves because I want other kids to see how awesome bugs really are—and how they actually help the Earth.
