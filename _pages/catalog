title: "Critter Coves"
---

Critter Coves let kids build and decorate their own bug habitats, which makes them way more fun and personal than the expensive bug hotels available. They're affordable, customizable, and come with seeds and bug food to attract real insects. Each kit also helps protect nature , and by building a Critter Cove, kids also learn cool stuff about different bugs and how they help the Earth. Itâ€™s fun, educational, and helps make the planet better!

For each kit purchased, we will make a $5 donation to the Xerces Society to support pollinators, fireflies, monarchs, and other important species. 

Currently, we have two different Critter Cove kits available.

The Xerces Society is an international nonprofit organization that protects the natural world through the conservation of invertebrates and their habitats. As a science-based organization, we both conduct our own research and rely upon the most up-to-date information to guide our conservation work. Our key program areas are: pollinator conservation, endangered species conservation, and reducing pesticide use and impacts.

Stay tuned for more Critter Cove kits in the future!
